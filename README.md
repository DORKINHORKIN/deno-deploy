# Monorepo Structure

- `backend/` - Application projects (e.g., api, cms)
- `frontend/` - Frontend application projects (e.g., index.html, main.tsx)
- `shared/` - Shared libraries and utilities and content

## Example Structure

``` plain
apps/
  web/
  api/
packages/
  ui/
  utils/
```

You can add new apps and packages as needed. Update import paths and configuration files to use this structure.
